# Data Visualization Tutorial

**Abstract.** Humans can more easily perceive differences in line lengths, shapes, and colors (hues) than process sequences of text or numbers. This ability makes data visualization a powerful tool for exploring, understanding, and communicating data. Creating effective data visualizations is a crucial research skill. Visualizations support research at various stages, from early prototypes over systematic experiments to final publications in papers/theses, presentations, or applications/demonstrations. This process often involves presenting the same data at different levels of detail or adapting styles for different audiences. Fortunately, many free tools are available for different types of visualizations, allowing us to choose what best fits our needs. This tutorial provides an overview of common visualization types and tools. We will discuss strategies for managing data visualizations in research, including automation, customization, and best practices. Through hands-on examples, we will explore the plotting library Matplotlib for static graphs and Chart.js for interactive web-based visualizations. Participants will be encouraged to share their experiences and insights throughout the session.

## Hands-on Examples

### Matplotlib for Static Graphs

1. Download the provided Jupyter notebook [tutorial.ipynb](https://github.com/klauck/data_visualization_tutorial/blob/main/1_matplotlib/tutorial.ipynb)

2. Open https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/lab/ in your browser

3. Upload and open the downloaded Jupyter notebook (see Step 1)


### Chart.js for Interactive Web Applications

1. Download the provided HTML page [dynamic_bar_chart.html](https://github.com/klauck/data_visualization_tutorial/blob/main/2_chart_js/dynamic_bar_chart.html)
2. Open the downloaded HTML page in your browser (see Step 1)
3. Open the downloaded HTML page in a text editor
   1. Inspect the code
   2. Follow the live tutorial instructions to adapt and reload the HTML page 

### Python `curses` for Terminal Applications

1. Download the provided Python script [dynamic_barplot.py](https://github.com/klauck/data_visualization_tutorial/blob/main/3_curses/dynamic_barplot.py)
2. Open a terminal, go to the download location, and run `python dynamic_barplot.py`
